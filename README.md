# Leghetto webshop backend

## Running the application in live mode

The developer is expected to have Java installed (Version 22 was used for this project).

Using the Maven wrapper included in the project, you can run application in live dev mode with:

```shell script
./mvnw quarkus:dev
```

The application will default to run on port 8080, which is also the expected port from the frontend app. The database is currently running locally on a Ubuntu server, which will be online until 31/1.
